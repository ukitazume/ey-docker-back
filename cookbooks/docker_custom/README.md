# engineyard-docker

Chef repository and  wrapper cookbook to deploy Docker on a utility instance in
Engineyard's 2016 stack.

## Docker Hub Credentials

If you need to input your Docker Hub credentials (or any other registry) to pull 
Docker images, perform the following steps:


1.  Login to your Docker host. By default it will be the util instance named
    `docker`.
2.  Run `docker login` and input your credentials.
3.  Check that you have generated your credentials file in
    `~deploy/.docker/config.json`.

## Third-party Docker Registries

To add additional registries, perform the following steps:

1. Update the `node['docker_custom']['registries']` attribute with the address
   of the Docker registry you are adding.
2. Run `docker login <address-of-other-registry>` to insert credentials for your
   third-party Docker registry.

## Alternative approaches

You can upload your `~/.docker/config.json` file from your workstation to your
instances instead.
