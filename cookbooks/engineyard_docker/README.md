# engineyard_docker

Chef wrapper library cookbook to deploy Docker on a utility instance in
Engineyard's 2016 stack.

This cookbook wraps the community Docker cookbook.

## Cookbook Dependencies

- [docker](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/docker)

## Instructions

The sample `Berksfile` generates the main Cookbook that the Engineyard CLI
recognizes:

```
berks vendor output/cookbooks
cd output
ey upload -e <target_environment>
ey apply -e <target_environment>
```

The sample main cookbook can be found in `test/cookbooks/main`.

## Resources overview

- `docker_installation_package_ebuild`: provides `docker_installation_package`
  for Gentoo platforms.
- `docker_service_manager_openrc`: manage docker daemon with an openrc script.

## docker_installation_package_ebuild

The `docker_installation_package_ebuild` resource uses the Gentoo's emerge
system package manager to install Docker. It relies on the pre-configuration of
the system's package repositories. 

This is the recommended production installation method.

### Example

```ruby
docker_installation_package 'default' do
  version '1.8.3'
  action :create
end
```

### Properties

- `version` - Used to calculate package_version string
- `package_version` - Manually specify the package version string
- `package_name` - Name of package to install. Defaults to 'docker-engine'
- `package_options` - Manually specify additional options, like emerge directives for example

## docker_service_manager_openrc

### Example

```ruby
docker_service_manager_openrc 'default' do
  action :start
end
```
